# Screen Navigation

Lesson will be a very short introduction to Thunkable `Screens`. This lesson will build on Lesson 1 `Big Red Button` as the initial screen in a larger application.

At the end of this lesson, students should have a good idea of what Thunkable `screens` are, and how to navigate between them from within an application. This will allow for building much more complicated applications.

Future lessons will have the option of building within this same app as separate pages within the app, or to start from scratch with a new app.

### Output

The resulting application will have multiple screens:

* A login screen (the `Big Red Button`)
* A loading screen
* A homepage
