# More Ideas
There are a lot of different ways to sign-in. See below for ideas to customize the way you sign in to your app.

### Button Sequence
You can add more buttons to the login screen, and have users push the buttons in a specific order to open the rest of the app.

A "real-life" similar example would be when Hagrid took Harry Potter to Diagon Alley for the first time. Hagrid tapped on a series of bricks to open the entrance.

You could even customize the buttons to make them look like bricks.

### Text Input
You could use a `Text Input` object and implement a basic PIN code or password.
