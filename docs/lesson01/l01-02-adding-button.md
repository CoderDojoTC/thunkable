# Adding the Big Red Button
In this step, you will add a button to the screen, and then change it into a Big Red Button.

### Add a button
Drag the `Button` item from the components tray on the left onto the screen viewer.

### Edit the button
In order to change the way the button looks, it needs to be selected. Select the button by either
* Clicking on the button in the screen viewer
* Clicking the name of the button in the App Tree in the upper left of the screen

Assign a name to the button: `BigRedButton`

Change the Text to say `?`

Change the Background Color to red

Set Font Size to `80`

Set Height to `Absolute Size`: 150

Set Width to `Absolute Size`: 150


### Add a label
Drag the `Label` item from the components tray onto the screen viewer

### Edit the label
Change it to something to get somebody to click your button! `Click Me!` is straight to the point.


### Next Step
The screen now looks exactly how we want it! You can take a look at it by [testing it.](../basics/basics-04-testing-saving.md) Unfortunately, the button does not do anything yet! Click the "Next" button below to program your button.
