# Saving and Testing a Thunkable Project
It can be useful to check the functionality of software at various points in the development process, and mobile apps are no exception. 

### Saving an app
A project is automatically saved whenever changes are made!

### In-browser live test
An app can be tested in two ways directly in the browser that is being used to create the app:
1. In the app Design page, the `preview` button in the upper right of the Screen Viewer will turn the Screen Viewer into a live testing screen, which can be clicked and interacted with.
2. On the upper right of the project's page, there is a Live Test button that opens a sample that can be interacted with, similar to option 1.

### Setting up a device

If a user has a mobile device for testing their newly developed applications, they will need to download [the Thunkable Live app](https://thunkable.com/#/mobile){target=_blank} from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

Sign into the Thunkable Live app with the same account that was used to create the app at the Thunkable website. After signing in to Thunkable Live, the user should see their app on their device under "My Projects." Clicking on the name of the app will open the app on the device. Any changes to the app on the Thunkable website should be reflected on the mobile device almost immediately.
