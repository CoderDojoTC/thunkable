# Getting Started with Thunkable

### Thunkable Prerequisites
* A computer or tablet that can reach the internet
* A Google account, Apple account, or email address
* Optional: A device to test applications (phone, tablet, etc)

### Sign-in
Using a computer or tablet, go to [the Thunkable website](https://x.thunkable.com/login){target=_blank} and sign-in with the Google, Apple, or email address account that you would like to use to store your applications.

### Creating a project
On the Thunkable website, if this is your first time signing in, there should be a large banner that says "Start Building." Click this banner, and a pop-up should appear to create a new Project. If you already have a Project, clicking Create New App will open the pop-up to create a new Project.

After confirming a name for the Project, the Thunkable Designer page will open. The first time signing in, an overlay will show on the screen with some tutorials.
