# CoderDojo Twin Cities Thunkable Resources

This website is for sharing teaching resources for Thunkable.

[Thunkable](https://thunkable.com/#/) is a free drag-and-drop tool used to build mobile applications on both Android and iPhone. The development environment is the Thunkable website, where anyone can sign in with a Google account.

Thunkable is replacing AppInventor as our mobile application development tool of choice, because Thunkable allows for the creation of iPhone apps in addition to Android. In addition, Thunkable makes testing and downloading apps much easier.
